## Contributing

The documentation on [http://omnisindustria.org](http://omnisindustria.org) is a collaborative project, everyone is encouraged to contribute.

The site is powered by [git-wiki](https://github.com/andrewhodel/git-wiki) so anyone on [Github](http://github.com) can contribute to the [repo](https://github.com/andrewhodel/omnisindustria).

Documentation is what we are creating, and git is an incredible open source tool for working together.

With [git-wiki](https://github.com/andrewhodel/git-wiki) we are able to document our work collaboratively, record a detailed commit history, and display it online for anyone to see.  **Git makes us a simple, revisioned central repository for 3d models and project files!**

Anyone can fork the project and re-host the data, with one click.  All the benefits of git and Github apply.

We also have a [G+ community](https://plus.google.com/communities/102975489424177341397)
